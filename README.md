# Realtime-Erosion-Simulation
Erosion simulation on procedurally generated terrain. Built using Unity, written in C# and HLSL.
- Simulating erosion due to water and heat on landscape, generating the eroded landscape.
- Uses compute shaders to achieve GPU parallelization. Runs at interactive framerates (40-50 fps).
- Generates realistic landscape features such as river valleys, mountain ridges and flood valleys.
- Currently uses a simple mesh and texture generator, to be updated.
